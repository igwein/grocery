# Python Testing

> This file extends [common/testing.md](../common/testing.md) with Python specific content.

## Current State

No test framework is configured yet. When tests are added, use **pytest**.

## Test Organization (for future use)

Use `pytest.mark` for test categorization:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_calculate_total():
    ...

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_database_connection():
    ...
```

## Reference

See skill: `python-testing` for detailed pytest patterns and fixtures.
